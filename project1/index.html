				My hobbies include:
				<ul>
					<li>Gaming</li>
					<li>Programming</li>
					<li>Building Electronic Circuts</li>
				</ul>
				Currently I am learning how to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speedrun" target="_blank">speedrun</a> Halo:CE on the PC as it was recently released as part of the Master Chief Collection of Halo games.<br>
			</p>
			<p>
				Most of my interests are science-fiction related movies, tv shows, and video games. Big franchises I follow are Star Wars and Halo. My current interests regarding programing are how machine learning models can be applied to biological computation. This field of study is referred to as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning_in_bioinformatics" target="_blank">Machine Learning in Bioinformatics.</a> This is a new field currently emerging, and is currently and will continue to be quite important to society.

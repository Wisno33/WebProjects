# WebProjects
My first set of web projects.

These all are very simple web projects, but are a nice baseline for HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL. These projects all built on each other and were assignments for my Internet Programming class.

## Project 1

This project consists of three components: a personal page, a schedule page, and an account creation page. These all utilize various tags from HTML, for a basic intro the the language and its various features. Also basic CSS styling is included.

## Project 2

This project is a payment processing page. This project focused on HTML entry fields, and served as an introduction to JavaScript for validation of the entry fields. The other focus was on how to integrate HTML and JavaScript.

## Project 3

A statistics calculator, this project further introduced the constructs of JavaScript, and again HTML and JavaScript integration

## Project 4 (Not active)

This project was the most complex, but is unfortunately not available for use. This is due to the requirements of a server for the PHP code along with a database server. Missing from the project are database files that we could not download or view on the server. This project was a movie checkout site. The user would create an account and could add moves to their cart and checkout. Although it is not working the relevant HTML and PHP code is available for viewing.
